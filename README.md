## SpaceInvadersHIT
The old "Space Invaders" game, implemented in C# with XNA 4.0 framework.
Handles sprite animation, input, sound, screens and collisions.
Mainly concentrated on design patterns and proper code architecture.

This project was created as part of a "3D Game Development" course during my BSc in Computer Science.
